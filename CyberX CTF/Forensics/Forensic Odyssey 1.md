## Step By Step Solve

1. First, we downlaod and unzip the Artifact.zip file with the password given by the challenge.
2. Inspect what inside the file.
   - There is only a file name ```CyberX_CTF.E01``` file.
3. Look closer, it is a ```E01``` extension file, as we know, ```E01```file is a file extension for Encase Disk Image or (Encase Evidence Files or Expert Witness Format (EWF) files) Google ^_^!
4. To open this file, we need to download Auotspy(https://www.autopsy.com/) or Eterro FTK Imager(https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager)
5. After that, open Autospy(for this time I use Autospy), but before others flag, we need to find the first flag, i have mount the image to local disk E and I can see there is a Welcome.txt file in the disk.
